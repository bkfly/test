# RF-PCA combined with ELM are used for classification
# Requirements
•	Matlab
# Usage
•Random forest algorithm for feature selection of data.  
•Principal component analysis is a feature extraction method, which can reduce the dimension of data.  
•Extreme learning machine algorithm can be used for data classification quickly.
